### *Key Takeaways*

#### Chapter 8
* CAB Process:
  * **High Risk**, *"fragile"* - changes must be authorized by CAB before being scheduled and implemented. pg 100
  * **Medium Risk**, *"messy middle"* - change submitter has responsibility and accountability for consulting and getting approval from people potentially affected. Once arranged, they submit the change to the CAB for review and scheduling. pg 102
  * **Low Risk**, *"standard"* - changes we've done many times successfully are preapproved. They still need to be submitted, but can be scheduled without the CAB. pg 102

#### Chapter 9
* Dealing with a SEV 1 incident pg 105
  * Need to know all changes
  * Finger pointing is unproductive 
  * Announce and discuss any changes before implementing pg 106
